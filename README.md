## About the Project
This project is a simple implementation of a Regular Expression (regex) matcher in C++. It provides a command-line interface for matching input strings against a given regex pattern. The regex engine supports a subset of the standard regex features, including:

- Literal characters
- The wildcard character `.`
- Character classes `[]`
- Start and end of line anchors `^` and `$`
- Grouping and alternation `|`
- Quantifiers `?`, `+`
- Escape sequences `\d`, `\w`

## Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repo
2. Compile the C++ file using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
3. Run the compiled program from the command line, passing the -E flag and your regex pattern as arguments.

### Prerequisites
This project is written in C++ and requires a C++ compiler. The code is compatible with C++11 and later versions.
